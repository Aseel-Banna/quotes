# quotes

I used the file [recentquotes.json](https://github.com/Aseel-Banna/quotes/blob/main/app/src/main/resources/recentquotes.json) to show random popular book quotes. 
In the app,  I used GSON to parse the .json file, and there is no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run, even there are more data inside the file. The app is choosing one quote each time it is run.
